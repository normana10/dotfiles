My dotfiles!

Utilizes `rcm`

As a quick `rcm` refresher:
* `lsrc`: Lists all the rc files managed by `rcm`
* `mkrc`: Moves the given fotfile to the dotfile dir and replaces with a symlink
* `rcdn`: Removes all the dotfiles managed by `rcm`
* `rcup`: Updates the rc files with those from the dotfile dir
